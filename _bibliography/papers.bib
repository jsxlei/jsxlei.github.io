              large datasets and increasingly powerful methods devoted to
              calculating genetic variants' effects on transcription,
              discrepancy between mRNA and protein levels hinders the
              systematic interpretation of the regulatory effects of
              disease-associated variants. Accurate models of the sequence
              determinants of translation are needed to close this gap and to
              interpret disease-associated variants that act on translation.
              Here, we present Translatomer, a multimodal transformer framework
              that predicts cell-type-specific translation from mRNA expression
              and gene sequence. We train Translatomer on 33 tissues and cell
              lines, and show that the inclusion of sequence substantially
              improves the prediction of ribosome profiling signal, indicating
              that Translatomer captures sequence-dependent translational
              regulatory information. Translatomer achieves accuracies of 0.72
              to 0.80 for de novo prediction of cell-type-specific ribosome
              profiling. We develop an in silico mutagenesis tool to estimate
              mutational effects on translation and demonstrate that variants
              associated with translation regulation are evolutionarily
              constrained, both within the human population and across species.
              Notably, we identify cell-type-specific translational regulatory
              mechanisms independent of eQTLs for 3,041 non-coding and
              synonymous variants associated with complex diseases, including
              Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and congenital heart disease.
              Translatomer accurately models the genetic underpinnings of
              translation, bridging the gap between mRNA and protein levels,
              and providing valuable mechanistic insights toward mapping
              ``missing regulation'' in disease genetics. \#\#\# Competing

              chromatin status and gene expression, driving cellular processes

              genes within the same embedding space and facilitate seamless
              zero-shot transfer to new data, we introduced scCLIP (single-cell
              Contrastive Learning Integration Pretraining), a generalized
              multi-modal transformer model with contrastive learning. We show
              that this model outperforms other competing methods, and beyond
              this, scCLIP learns transferable features across modalities and
              generalizes to unseen datasets, which pose the great potential to
              bridge the vast number of unpaired unimodal datasets both
              existing and new data generated in the future. Specifically, we
              propose the first large-scale transformer model designed for

              microfocus X-ray diffraction, we determined the structure of
              human GLUT3 in complex with D-glucose at 1.5 {\AA} resolution in
              an outward-occluded conformation. The high-resolution structure
              allows discrimination of both $\alpha$- and $\beta$-anomers of
              D-glucose. Two additional structures of GLUT3 bound to the
              exofacial inhibitor maltose were obtained at 2.6 {\AA} in the
              outward-open and 2.4 {\AA} in the outward-occluded states. In all
              three structures, the ligands are predominantly coordinated by
              polar residues from the carboxy terminal domain. Conformational
              transition from outward-open to outward-occluded entails a

              amino-terminal domain undergoes rigid-body rotation with respect
