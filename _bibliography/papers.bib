  abstract  = "Gene expression involves transcription and translation. Despite large datasets
             and increasingly powerful methods devoted to calculating genetic variants' effects 
             on transcription, discrepancy between messenger RNA and protein levels hinders the 
             systematic interpretation of the regulatory effects of disease-associated variants. 
             Accurate models of the sequence determinants of translation are needed to close this 
             gap and to interpret disease-associated variants that act on translation. Here we 
             present Translatomer, a multimodal transformer framework that predicts cell-type-specific 
             translation from messenger RNA expression and gene sequence. We train the Translatomer on 
             33 tissues and cell lines, and show that the inclusion of sequence improves the prediction 
             of ribosome profiling signal, indicating that the Translatomer captures sequence-dependent 
             translational regulatory information. The Translatomer achieves accuracies of 0.72 to 0.80 
             for the de novo prediction of cell-type-specific ribosome profiling. We develop an in silico 
             mutagenesis tool to estimate mutational effects on translation and demonstrate that variants 
             associated with translation regulation are evolutionarily constrained, both in the human 
             population and across species. In particular, we identify cell-type-specific translational 
             regulatory mechanisms independent of the expression quantitative trait loci for 3,041 
             non-coding and synonymous variants associated with complex diseases, including Alzheimer's 
             disease, schizophrenia and congenital heart disease. The Translatomer accurately models the 
             genetic underpinnings of translation, bridging the gap between messenger RNA and protein 
             levels as well as providing valuable mechanistic insights for uninterpreted disease variants.",

                   (scATAC-seq) technologies holds great promise for
                   investigating the heterogeneity of epigenetic landscapes at
                   the cellular level. The amplification process in scATAC-seq
                   experiments often introduces noise due to dropout events,
                   which results in extreme sparsity that hinders accurate
                   analysis. Consequently, there is a significant demand for the
                   generation of high-quality scATAC-seq data in silico.
                   Furthermore, current methodologies are typically
                   task-specific, lacking a versatile framework capable of
                   handling multiple tasks within a single model. In this work,
                   we propose ATAC-Diff, a versatile framework, which is based
                   on a latent diffusion model conditioned on the latent
                   auxiliary variables to adapt for various tasks. ATAC-Diff is
                   the first diffusion model for the scATAC-seq data generation
                   and analysis, composed of auxiliary modules encoding the
                   latent high-level variables to enable the model to learn the
                   semantic information to sample high-quality data. Gaussian
                   Mixture Model (GMM) as the latent prior and auxiliary
                   decoder, the yield variables reserve the refined genomic
                   information beneficial for downstream analyses. Another
                   innovation is the incorporation of mutual information between
                   observed and hidden variables as a regularization term to
                   prevent the model from decoupling from latent variables.
                   Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ATAC-Diff
                   achieves high performance in both generation and analysis
                   tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art models.",

              Caenorhabditis elegans, particularly in the germline, but the
              precise mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. Through
              an analysis of the transcription factors profile of C. elegans, we
              discovered that the expression of several transgenic reporter
              lines exhibited tissue-specific silencing, specifically in the
              intestine of C. elegans. Notably, this silencing could be reversed
              in mutants defective in endogenous RNA interference (RNAi).
              Further investigation using knock-in strains revealed that these
              intestine-silent genes were indeed expressed in vivo, indicating
              that the organism itself regulates the intestine-specific
              silencing. This tissue-specific silencing appears to be mediated
              through the endo-RNAi pathway, with the main factors of this
              pathway, mut-2 and mut-16, are significantly enriched in the
              intestine. Additionally, histone modification factors, such as
              met-2, are involved in this silencing mechanism. Given the crucial
              role of the intestine in reproduction alongside the germline, the
              transgene silencing observed in the intestine reflects the
              self-protective mechanisms employed by the organisms. In summary,
              our study proposed that compared to other tissues, the transgenic
              silencing of intestine is specifically regulated by the endo-RNAi
              pathway.",
